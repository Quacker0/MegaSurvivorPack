My discord https://discord.gg/rA7MyXSgjR


WARNING Most of the "Survivors" are hard to use or impossible to survive very long with and with the larger "Survivors" most of the time they can’t open chests i have somewhat tried to fix this but it is still a problem




This mod currently lets you play as most of the enemies in the game and some of the bosses (this list is a little outdated)
- Bandit
- Sniper
- Hand
- Beetle Guard
- Magma Worm
- Overloading Worm	
- Imp Overlord
- Aurelionite
- Beetle
- Bighorn Bison
- TC-280 Prototype
- Stone Golem
- Greater Wisp
- Imp
- Elder Lemurian
- Lemurian
- Stone Titan
- Paladin
- Bell
- ClayBruiser
- RoboBallBoss
- Vulture

Bandit's "R" currently is very bad
Sniper's model is a untextured commando and icon in survivor select is the commando and name is "???"
Paladin's model is a untextured commando and name is commando in the survivor screen

I do not know if i will continue to update this mod the source is in git feel free to pull request and il update the mod
